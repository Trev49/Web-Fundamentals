      <h3>[Tablet PC's]</h3>
      <p>
        Tablet PC's are small portable devices that are becoming more popular every year! They appeal to many as they are super portable which is ideal for college students. Here is the breakdown for what these devices entail!
      </p>
      <p>
        Pros: As mentioned earlier, these devices are great on the go devices. They have high battery life, and work with common used applications like office, and a few developmental applications as well. You get a full PC OS experience which makes learning curves seemless for those accustomed to PCs. This is what makes these devices useful for many businesses especially as most as compatible with most kinds of businesses. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Cons: While these devices are nice and flexible they lack power. Running high end applications like movie editing, design, gaming, and other things that require high speeds may struggle overtime. SOme of these apps may appear to run normal and this leads to another flaw. The cooling system in these devices are super limited and risks of overheating could occur if these types of apps are used long term. They are also really expensive to get which for the average college student is too expensive for them to even consider. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Rundown: Tablet PCs are ideal for those who prefer long battery life, portability, and have many different things to go to each day. Even with the higher costs, they will acomplish most needs of college students.

      <h3>Standard Laptops</h3>
      <p>
        These types of laptops are also really common and you likely grew up with these as they have been around for decades. They are what you expect for the most part but there are lots of different features that come depending on the model that you have. You will likely see these kind of devices as seen in these images.
      </p>
      <p>

You can often find a standard laptop betweeen $300 to $500 range and they come with a variety of ports to allow connections to any external equipment as needed. As mentioned earlier the lower price range makes it more affordable for college students and they will be able to acomplish most if not all things that a college student needs to do. The bigger size allows for better cooling allowing some more higher power software.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cons: While they are really useful and affordable. They can become a little bulky to carry around making it less portable compared to other options out there. Standard Laptops vary greatly when it comes to durability. There have been reports of people having issues after a year. Some others will last years. You really never know how long they will last. Battery quaility often wears out quickly requirng bringing power cords. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Rundown: Standard Laptops are great options for those who are just looking for something simple and easy to use without advanced new technology. Their huge variety allows you to find the one that works best for you. Even with the varied reliability, many people use them for everyday studies and has worked for many years. This type of device is recommended for people who are beginners to computing as well.
