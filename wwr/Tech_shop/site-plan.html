        Tablet PCs are small portable devices that are becoming more popular
        every year! They appeal to many as they are super portable which is
        ideal for college students. Here is the breakdown for what these devices
        entail!
      </p>
      <h2>Pros:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          As mentioned earlier, these devices are great on-the-go devices.
        </li>
        <li>
          They have high battery life and work with commonly used applications
          like office and a few developmental applications as well.
        </li>
        <li>
          You get a full PC OS experience which makes the learning curve
          seamless for those accustomed to PCs.
        </li>
        <li>
          This is what makes these devices useful for many businesses especially
          as most are compatible with various kinds of business applications.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Cons:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          While these devices are nice and flexible, they lack power for running
          high-end applications like movie editing, design, gaming, and other
          CPU-intensive tasks.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some of these apps may appear to run normally initially, but the
          limited cooling system in these devices risks overheating if used
          extensively for such tasks.
        </li>
        <li>
          They are also quite expensive, making them unaffordable for the
          average college student.
        </li>
      </ul>
