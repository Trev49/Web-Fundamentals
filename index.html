<h1>About me</h1>
<p>My name is Trevor and I just recently returned from my mission a couple weeks ago from Georgia.</p>
<p>I am majoring in Computer Information Technology but looking to eventually get into Cyber Security. I have two younger sibblings and from Northern California. I have been to many other states including Nevada, Utah, Hawaii, Georgia, and even went out of the country into the UK. I am hoping to visit more paces in the future.</p>
